   <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes". </p>

        Sheffield F.C. (here pictured in 1857, the year of its foundation) is the oldest surviving association football club in the world.
        
        Notes about a Sheffield v. Hallam match, dated 29 December 1862
        Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[67][65]
        
        The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[68][69] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[69]
        
        In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.[70] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.
        
        The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
        
        13 February 1856: Charterhouse School v. St Bartholemew's Hospital.[71]
        7 November 1856: Bedford Grammar School v. Bedford Town Gentlemen.[72]
        13 December 1856: Sunbury Military College v. Littleton Gentlemen.[73]
        December 1857: Edinburgh University v. Edinburgh Academical Club.[74]
        24 November 1858: Westminster School v. Dingley Dell Club.[75]
        12 May 1859: Tavistock School v. Princetown School.[76]
        5 November 1859: Eton School v. Oxford University.[77]
        22 February 1860: Charterhouse School v. Dingley Dell Club.[78]
        21 July 1860: Melbourne v. Richmond.[79]
        17 December 1860: 58th Regiment v. Sheffield.[80]
        26 December 1860: Sheffield v. Hallam </p>
